      Snapshot tests are a great way of ensuring that any changes don't unexpectedly change the output of other components and affect the wider UI.

      A typical snapshot tests renders a UI component, takes a snapshot, then creates or compares it to a reference snapshot file stored alongside the test. A snapshot test will fail if there is any mismatch between the new and reference snapshot. Either a change needs to be reverted or the snapshot needs to be updated.
